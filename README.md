# BitToBrain  
**Cheat Sheet-Based DSA Practice — One Bit at a Time, Towards a Sharper Brain**

Welcome to **BitToBrain** — my dedicated space to practice and master Data Structures & Algorithms by following some of the most structured and result-driven cheat sheets.

This repository is not just a collection of solutions — it’s a reflection of consistent learning, problem-solving discipline, and the belief that **small efforts compound into mastery**.

## 🎯 Why I Created This Repo

While preparing for coding interviews and competitive platforms, I realized how scattered things can get. This repo is my way of bringing together:
- The best curated questions from trusted sources
- A structure that makes revision and progress tracking simple
- A habit of committing publicly — to stay accountable and consistent

My goal?  
> Turn every small "bit" of learning into something powerful for the brain.
